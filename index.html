                <h4 style = "position:relative; top: 20%; left: 5%; word-wrap: break-word;max-width: 90%;">Dostoevsky is probably the most famous and the most read Russian author.
                However, the journey of his mysterious profound writings has never come to an end.
                With each reading a new door opens to a road to the meanings and problems of life.<br>
                Dostoyevsky is usually regarded as one of the finest novelists who ever lived. Literary modernism,
                 existentialism, and various schools of psychology, theology, and literary criticism have been profoundly 
                 shaped by his ideas. His works are often called prophetic because he so accurately predicted how Russiaâ€™s 
                 revolutionaries would behave if they came to power. In his time he was also renowned for his activity as a 
                 journalist.
